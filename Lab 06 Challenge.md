# Lab 06 Challenge
For this week's challenge, add a function to your code called draw that takes the following parameters:

    * a turtle
    * a string
    * a number
The turtle will be the same turtle you initialized in the main function passed to this function. It will do the drawing.

Possible values for the string will be "left" or "forward"

the number will be a positive integer

## In the function:

If the value of the string is "left", tell the turtle to turn left using the number in the third parameter
If the value of the string is "forward", tell the turtle to move forward using the number in the third parameter
Lastly, add some function calls to your main function to test your new draw function.
